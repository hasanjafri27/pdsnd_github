## Project Title
Bikeshare Project

## Description
This Python script is written for Project 2 of Udacity's Programming For Data Science Nanodegree and is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.


## Datasets
The data for this project is provided by the company 'Motivate'. Some data wrangling has been performed by udacity's staff to condense these files to the core six columns to make your analysis and the evaluation of your Python skills more straightforward. Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

1) Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
2) End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
3) Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
4) Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
5) End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
6) User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
1) Gender (Male or Female)
2) Birth Year (e.g., 1990)

## Files used
1) chicago.csv
2) washington.csv
3) new_york_city.csv

## Questions answered
The script provides the following information about the bike share data:

1) Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

2) Popular stations and trip
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3) Trip duration
total travel time
average travel time

4) User info
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
